# Haskell solution
This directory contains the solutions in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

## Requirements
You need the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to run the solutions.
If you want to go on working with Haskell I recommend the whole Haskell Platform.
You can download it [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

### Run it
I suggest to use `solve` in the root directory.
It executes `run <DayXX> <../input/DayXX.txt`.
To delete all compiled files, you can use `clean`.

## Contribution
As I am not very familiar with monads and IO functions I appreciate every enhancement.
Just open an issue with your concerns so we can discuss it.
